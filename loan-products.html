<img src="images/star.jpg" style="float:left;max-width:20px;width:auto;"><h3 id="q1">Home Loans</h3><br>
<p>
We manage the process from application through to successful settlement on your behalf. 
This includes talking to your existing financier if you wish to re-finance. We take the work and hassle out of the process and manage every step along the way to make a smooth transaction from one lender to another. We can even manage the valuation of your property. 
<br><br>
If you are purchasing an established home or building a new home or even if this is your first home or subsequent home, we can take the head ache and hassle out of liasing with real estate agents, conveyancers, valuers and the bank to make your dream come true.
</p>
<hr><br>

<img src="images/star.jpg" style="float:left;max-width:20px;width:auto;"><h3 id="q2">First Home Buyers</h3><br>
<p>
We are frequently asked by first home buyers how they can enter the property market in todays economic climate. The answer can vary depending on their financial position. 
<br><br>
At Homecorp, we have many products that can be tailored to suit the needs of most first home owners. All you need to do is speak to one of dedicated staff members who specialise in this area of lending.
</p>

<img src="images/star.jpg" style="float:left;max-width:20px;width:auto;"><h3 id="q3">Commercial & Business Loans</h3><br>
<p>
Commerical and Business Loans require special expertise, due to the unusual circumstances that present themselves. For example, the maximum loan term, the security offered, income streams and the clients experience in their field. Obtaining correct advise for starting a new business or expanding an existing business is a pre-requisite in order to borrow the funds. Sometimes having an informal chat can help immeasurably with this process.
</p>

<hr><br>
<img src="images/star.jpg" style="float:left;max-width:20px;width:auto;"><h3 id="q4">Investment Loans</h3><br>
<p>
Creating wealth through property investment is the path that many of our clients choose to take. With increasing property values in recent times along with rental increases makes property investment a viable option for some clients. Using the equity of an existing property can potentially mean acquiring an additional property. This can be done with little or no upfront out-of-pocket expenses. Please contact us for individual senarios.
</p>

<hr><br>
<img src="images/star.jpg" style="float:left;max-width:20px;width:auto;"><h3 id="q5">Land Loans</h3><br>
<p>
The acquisition of vacant land can be the first step to property ownership, whether it be for a House & Land Package or Vacant Land only.
<br><br>
At Homecorp, we can facilitate and taylor land loans to suit the requirements of individual clients. Funding is available up to 100% of the purchase price. For more information, contact one of our fully qualified consultants.
</p>

<hr><br>
<img src="images/star.jpg" style="float:left;max-width:20px;width:auto;"><h3 id="q6">Construction Loans</h3><br>
<p>
Building your dream home is the dream of many Australians. The construction of a home can present great opportunity to have exactly what you want, and not what somebody else wants to thrust upon you. Our Construction Loans provide for exactly this. If you haven't built before, we can help make it easy and show you how to avoid the pitfalls of the construction process. Our consultants have over 10 years of experience in construction loans.
</p>

<hr><br>
<img src="images/star.jpg" style="float:left;max-width:20px;width:auto;"><h3 id="q7">No Financials</h3><br>
<p>
For what ever reason, some of our clients are unable to provide up-to-date Tax Returns and Profit & Loss Statements. These clients are usually self-employed or have recently engaged in employment. Often all that is required is to look at alternatives around these particular issues. 
<br><br>
One of our motto's at Homecorp Finance is that in the vast majority of circumstances, we will find a way to achieve a successful outcome.
</p>

<hr><br>
<img src="images/star.jpg" style="float:left;max-width:20px;width:auto;"><h3 id="q8">Difficult Loans</h3><br>
<p>
Many borrowers are unsure if they can qualify for a home loan due to unusual circumstances. These can include a checkered credit history, short-term employment, self employment or new arrivals to the country. A Homecorp consultant will take the time to discuss any of these unusual circumstances with a prospective borrower. Finding out how to proceed can be of great benefit to someone who is in one of the above circumstances.
</p>

<hr><br>
<img src="images/star.jpg" style="float:left;max-width:20px;width:auto;"><h3 id="q9">Car/Personal Loans</h3><br>
<p>
Both secured or unsecured personal loans are two products at our disposal to suit the needs of some borrowers. The purchase of a vehicle or to consolidate existing debts are a couple of many needs that can be satisfied with a personal/car loan. We have access to several lenders with varying products to suit your particular needs.
